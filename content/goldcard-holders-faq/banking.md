## Transferring Money to Taiwan

### Revolut

With a Revolut account, you can easily and cheaply transfer money to a Taiwanese bank account. **Note that Revolut does not support NTD as a currency, so you have to transfer USD, which means that your Taiwanese bank account needs to support USD.**

Revolut charges 0.5% for foreign exchange exceeding ~$1000 USD per month. They also charge $3-4 USD for SWIFT transfers. Typically Taiwanese banks will charge a fee on incoming USD transfers (e.g. Fubon charges $7 USD), but they're USD to NTD rates are usually extremely good.

With a free Revolut account ATM card you can withdraw up to ~$200 USD per month without any fees (after which they charge 2%). Bank of Taiwan and Fubon ATMs work well with Revolut cards and don't charge any fees. Some other banks may charge a fee!

### TransferWise

Similar to Revolut, you can easily and cheaply transfer money to a Taiwanese bank account using TransferWise. **Note that TransferWise does not support NTD as a currency, so you have to transfer USD, which means that your Taiwanese bank account needs to support USD.**

TransferWise charges $3.2 USD for SWIFT transfers. Their foreign exchange rate is roughly similar to Revolut.

If you're source/sender currency is USD then you have to create a **Same-Currency** transfer and select USD.
